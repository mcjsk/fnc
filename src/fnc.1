.Nm
is an interactive read-only browser for
.Xr fossil 1
repositories,
and supports multiple views to display repository data:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Timeline view
Display commits from the repository's history in chronologically
descending order.

If no
.Ar command
or
.Ar arg
are specified, or just a
.Ar path
is passed,
.Nm
will default to displaying this view.
.It Diff view
Display changes introduced in the specified commit, or between two repository
artifacts.
.It Tree view
Display navigable tree reflecting the repository state as at the specified
commit.
.It Blame view
Display and annotate each line in the given file with the hyperlinked historical
version that last modified the line.
.It Branch view
Display navigable list of all repository branches.
.El

provides both global and command-specific options and in-app key
bindings.  Global options are specified absent a command name, and
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width 6v
.It Fl h , -help
Display program help and usage information then exit.
.It Fl v , -version
Display program version then exit.
.El
.Pp
Note that any global options preceding a command name will be
interpreted as the command-specific variant if such an option exists.
.Pp
Global key bindings are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm H, ?, F1
Display in-app help.
.It Cm Tab
Switch focus between open views.

.Dl (aliases: Cm log , Cm tl , Cm time , Cm ti )
Display commit history of a repository.  If
.Ar path
is specified, only commits that modified the file(s) at this path will populate
the timeline.  The
.Ar path
may be absolute, relative to the current working directory, or relative to the
repository root.  This command must be executed from within or below the top
level directory of the repository; that is,
.Nm
assumes a local checkout is open in or above the current working directory.
.Pp
If no command is explicitly specified, this command will be executed by
default.
.Pp
Options for
.Cm fnc timeline
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b , -branch Ar branch
Display commits that are members of the specified
.Ar branch .
The expected argument is the symbolic name of a branch. By default,
.Nm
will display all commits irrespective of the branch on which they
reside.
.It Fl C , -no-colour
Disable colourised timeline, which is enabled by default on supported
terminals. If this option is not used, colour can be toggled with the
.Sy c
timeline view key binding as documented below.
User-defined colours are also supported, see
.Sx ENVIRONMENT
for details.
.It Fl c , -commit Ar commit
Open the timeline from the check-in identified by
.Ar commit .
The expected argument is either the name of a branch, which will resolve
to the latest commit on the given branch, or (a unique abbreviated
prefix of) a valid commit UUID SHA1 or SHA3 hash. When this option is
not supplied,
.Nm
will open the timeline to the latest leaf on the repository tree.  For a
complete list of valid arguments this option accepts, see
.Lk https://fossil-scm.org/home/doc/trunk/www/checkin_names.wiki \
"Fossil's Check-in Names".
.It Fl h , -help
Display timeline command help and usage information then exit.
.It Fl n , -limit Ar n

latest
.Ar n
commits.
By default,
.Nm
will load the entire history of the repository's local checkout.
Negative values are a no-op.
.It Fl T , -tag Ar tag
Only display commits with T cards containing
.Ar tag .
By default,
.Nm
will indiscriminately display all commits irrespective of which T cards
are attached to the commit manifest.
.It Fl t , -type Ar type
Only display
.Ar type
commits. Valid
.Ar type
values are as follows:
.Bl -column -offset 2s YXZ description
.Sy ci Ta check-in

.Nm
will diff the current checkout, including any local changes on disk, against
this version.  When both arguments are specified, the changes between these two
versions will be displayed.  If supplied,
.Nm
will filter diffs between commits by
.Ar path
so that only changes involving the file(s) identified are displayed.  Paths may
be absolute, relative to the current working directory, or relative to the
repository root.  Both
.Ar artifact1
and
.Ar artifact2
must be of the same type, which is expected to be either a symbolic check-in
name, tag, (unique abbreviated prefix of) a commit or blob artifact UUID SHA1
or SHA3 hash, or an ISO 8601 formatted date. Both artifact arguments must be
supplied when diffing blobs; any following non-option arguments are invalid
and will be ignored.
.Pp
Options for
.Cm fnc diff
are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds

Display navigable, hierarchical tree of a repository.  If a
.Ar path
is specified, display tree nodes of this path.  The
.Ar path
may be absolute, relative to the current working directory, or relative to the
repository root.  With no options passed, the tree will reflect the state of the
latest commit on trunk.  This command must be executed from within or below the
top level directory of the repository; that is,
.Nm
assumes a local checkout is open in or above the current working directory.
.Pp
Tree nodes are lexicographically ordered and may be postfixed with an identifier
corresponding to the mode of the file object on disk as returned by
.Xr lstat 2 :

"Fossil's Check-in Names".
.It Fl h , -help
Display blame command help and usage information then exit.
.It Fl n , -limit Ar n
Limit depth of blame history to
.Ar n
commits or seconds.  The latter is denoted by a postfixed 's' (e.g., 30s).
With this option,
.Nm
will traverse either as many commits as specified, or as possible in the
specified time limit.  By default,
.Nm
will traverse the entire historical record of the file, which can be expensive
for large files that span many commits. Use this option for a faster, more
targeted annotation.
.It Fl r , -reverse
Reverse annotate the file starting from a historical commit and move forward in
time. That is, rather than show the most recent change to each line, show the
first time each line was modified by a subsequent commit after the specified
.Ar commit .
